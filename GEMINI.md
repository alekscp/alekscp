# Project Overview

This is a personal portfolio website for Aleks CP, a DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure Engineer. It's a static, single-page website built with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. The site is designed to be simple, fast, and easily maintainable.

# Building and Running

This is a static website, so there is no build process. To run the website, you can open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.

# Development Conventions

There are no explicit development conventions, but the code is well-formatted and easy to read. The CSS is embedded in the `<style>` tag in the `<head>` of the HTML file, and the JavaScript is in a `<script>` tag at the end of the `<body>`.
