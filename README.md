# 👋 Hi, I'm Aleks Clapin-Pépin  
**Independent DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure Engineer**

I design, automate, and operate production-grade infrastructure for startups and technology companies.  
My focus is building systems that are **secure**, **scalable**, and **maintainable** — from cloud-native platforms to bare-metal deployments.  
I also contribute to backend development when needed, bridging infrastructure and application layers for smoother workflows and faster delivery.

### 🧠 What I Do
- Architect and automate infrastructure using **Terraform**, **AWS**, **Docker**, **GitHub Actions**, and **Ansible**  
- Design **CI/CD pipelines**, observability stacks, and infrastructure as code  
- Deploy and manage high-performance environments on **cloud and bare-metal** setups  
- Collaborate closely with developers, writing backend code and integrating infrastructure within product teams  
- Help startups move from MVP to production with pragmatic, cost-efficient infrastructure
